Recursion is when you repeat a function within itself in order to simplify the function. For example, if you are trying to find the factorial of a function, you can check if the inputted value is 1. If the inputted value is 1, you return 1, but if not, you return the inputted number multiplied by the function of the inputted number minus 1. This will create a loop in which you keep reducing your given number by one until you get to 1, then multiply each value you get to derive the factorial. This demonstrated recursion, for the function is being repeated within itself - the defining factor of recursion.
